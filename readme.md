This Repo is about Technical Assessment for CHEQ Interview 2nd phase. The instructions for the task were to find the maximum and the minimum price of the products from a given webpage and print out their name and description. I have used Python as programming language to complete the tasks. I have imported the build-in libraries to get the response from the URL and also to parse the html code from the web. I have used for loop to get the name, description and the prices from multiple products and then stated the conditional to check the maximum or minimum prices from those products and inserted it inside a dictionary. And finally, I have printed the name and the description of the product.
Note: This code is not working as html parsing was failed. While I am trying to parse the html code it was returning some comments and git repo links. I could have done the tasks with the help of Selenium4 but as I was instructed to avoid any GUI tools then I have come up with completing the tasks using Python Scripting.
